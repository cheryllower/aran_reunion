### Accomodation
The Aran planning team has made arrangements with the **Indochina Hotel** (formerly called the Inpound Hotel and built in the late 80s/early 90s).  Kings (one bed) and doubles are available at THB 800.00 per night inclusive of breakfast.  Fifty rooms have been reserved and the hotel has about 115 so hopefully we can all fit there.  You can find details about the hotel on TripAdvisor [here](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g729369-d2176037-Reviews-Hotel_Indochina-Aranyaprathet_Sa_Kaeo_Province.html). 

### Transport between Bangkok and Aran
As of now, there is __no plan__ to organize chartered vans between Bangkok and Aran; we'll let you know if that changes.  There are loads of public transportation options.

### Cost
The event fee will be approximately __THB 2000-2500__ per person.  This will include two dinners (Friday and Saturday) and van transportation for Saturday's outing.  __Hotel is THB 800 per night.__  

These can be paid in Aran; no advance payment necessary.

### Reminder of things to bring

In addition to all the things you know you’ll pack, don’t forget about Toni Shapiro-Phim’s cultural project.  

Toni writes, “I’m offering to create a photographic essay that will highlight memories of those who worked on the Thai-Cambodian border in the 1980s and early 1990s. One aim is to add to the historic record. Another is to draw attention to the tensions and contradictions of choosing to work in a place where the inhabitants have limited or no choice about when to leave and where to go; of being witness to the unimaginable; of developing valued relationships, skills and knowledge, and of being able to use those skills and knowledge to great impact. 

I’d love for any of you who’d like to participate to bring a print of one picture from your time on the border to the reunion. I’ll photograph each person holding the picture, and interview each about the photo: Why did you select that image? What does it bring to mind? I’ll share the portraits and accompanying captions/stories in an on-line photo essay posted on the website of the Cambodian Association of Greater Philadelphia (CAGP) at Cambodian New Year in April 2015. Around the same time, CAGP will be producing a photo essay focused on local Cambodians who had been border camp residents. So the photo essays will complement one another. (Photo size preference is 8 x 10 inches/20 x 25 cm, but any size print will be fine. If it isn’t possible to bring a print, we can still take a portrait and work something out regarding the photograph from the days on the border…)
