### Accomodation
The Aran planning team has made arrangements with the **Indochina Hotel** (formerly called the Inpound Hotel and built in the late 80s/early 90s).  Kings (one bed) and doubles are available at THB 800.00 per night inclusive of breakfast.  Fifty rooms have been reserved and the hotel has about 115 so hopefully we can all fit there.  You can find details about the hotel on TripAdvisor [here](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g729369-d2176037-Reviews-Hotel_Indochina-Aranyaprathet_Sa_Kaeo_Province.html). 

### Transport between Bangkok and Aran
As of now, there is __no plan__ to organize chartered vans between Bangkok and Aran; we'll let you know if that changes.  There are loads of public transportation options.

### Cost
The event fee will be approximately __THB 2000-2500__ per person.  This will include two dinners (Friday and Saturday) and van transportation for Saturday's outing.  __Hotel is THB 800 per night.__  

These can be paid in Aran; no advance payment necessary.
