<p>The Aran planning team has made arrangements with the <strong>Indochina Hotel</strong> (formerly called the Inpound Hotel and built in the late 80s/early 90s).  Kings (one bed) and doubles are available at THB 800.00 per night inclusive of breakfast.  Fifty rooms have been reserved and the hotel has about 115 so hopefully we can all fit there.  You can find details about the hotel on TripAdvisor <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g729369-d2176037-Reviews-Hotel_Indochina-Aranyaprathet_Sa_Kaeo_Province.html">here</a>. </p>
